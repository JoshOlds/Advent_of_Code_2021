# Advent of Code 2021!

All of my 2021 solutions are written in Rust. Rust makes it super easy to build executables. If you would like to try out my solutions, all you will need to do is:
 - Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
 - Clone this repository
 - In your terminal (or Powershell on Windows), browse to the directory that you cloned this repo to.
 - Run 'cargo run'
   - This will build and execute every day's solution. If you would like to run only a single day, execute 'cargo run -p dayX'
   
If you would like to measure optimized performance, run 'cargo run --release'

## Current Execution Times (for optimized build over 10,000 iterations)
- Day 1: ~50us
- Day 2: ~44us
- Day 3: ~193us
- Day 4: ~730us
- Day 5: ~710us
